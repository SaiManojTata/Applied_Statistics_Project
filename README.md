# Applied_Statistics_Project

Our project is to analyze the sleep patterns of IITH students. The objective is to identify various factors which affect our sleep and the way they affect us.

The variables of interest for this study are: - 
 
Response variables (Response Variable is the focus of question in a study)
* Number of hours of sleep(night)(continuous numerical/Ordinal Categorical)
* Start time of sleep (night)(continuous numerical)

Explanatory variables (variable(we know) that affect response variables)
* Whether a person consume caffeine, yes/no (Nominal/Regular Categorical)
* How many times caffeinated drinks are consumed per day(OrdinalCategorical)
* How and at when do people watch lectures (Nominal/Regular Categorical)
* How and when do people submit assignments?(Nominal/Regular Categorical)
* Screen time to study(Ordinal Categorical / continuous numerical)
* Start time of study (continuous numerical)
* Screen time other than study(Ordinal Categorical / continuous numerical)
* Time spent on physical activities(Ordinal Categorical)
               
As our interest is to analyze natural sleeping patterns we perform an observational study, we neglect the effect of any confounding variables.

We used sampling more specifically volunteer sampling for collection of data by sending mail to every student at IITH but only a few of them volunteered to respond. To make as many people respond as possible we also send remainders. We managed to collect data from 132 people, the data is diverse with data from all years of UG, PG and PhD students.
