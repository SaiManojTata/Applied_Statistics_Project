# Applied Statistics Project

Our project is to analyze the sleep patterns of IITH students. The objective is to identify various factors which affect our sleep and the way they affect us.

The variables of interest for this study are: - 
 
Response variables (Response Variable is the focus of question in a study)
* Number of hours of sleep(night)
* Start time of sleep (night)

Explanatory variables (Variables that affect response variables)
* Whether a person consume caffeine, yes/no 
* How many times caffeinated drinks are consumed per day
* How and at when do people watch lectures 
* How and when do people submit assignments?
* Screen time to study
* Start time of study 
* Screen time other than study
* Time spent on physical activities
               
As our interest is to analyze natural sleeping patterns we perform an observational study, we neglect the effect of any confounding variables.

We used sampling more specifically volunteer sampling for collection of data by sending mail to every student at IITH but only a few of them volunteered to respond. To make as many people respond as possible we also send remainders. We managed to collect data from 132 people, the data is diverse with data from all years of UG, PG and PhD students.
